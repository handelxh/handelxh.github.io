## About

Thanks for dropping by. I hope that it will not waste your time, but in case it does, at least I tried.
Originally from BeiJing, china, I started my adventures in computer Science and Technology from University of BUAA where I received my Bachelor in automatic Science and Master in IC Engineering.
NOW I work for VIA.
While attending my master's, I was working as a Embedded Software Engineering.VIA won me and became my first working place in my life.

But, apart from being a <strike>cool guy</strike> geek,
I enjoy playing basketball and love NBA games very much.I'm a fans for Houston Rockets. 

Opinions expressed here are mine.
